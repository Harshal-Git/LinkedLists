# LinkedLists
Linked lists programs


###
Types of implementations for Linked list (apart from standard Java implementation):

1. Doubly linked list
2. Circular linked list  
3. Dictionary operations using singly / circular linked list (from Cormen - Page: 240)
4. Dynamic set operation- UNION with list DS (from Cormen - Page: 241)
5. Reversing a linked list (from Cormen - Page: 241)
6. Doubly linked list using single pointer (XOR operation) (from Cormen - Page: 241)
7. Memory efficient linked list operations (from Cormen - Page: 245)
	ex: Multi-array version, Single array version (for such programming languages where pointers support is not present)
